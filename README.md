# [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) Project Template

Welcome to Wisemen's Nuxt3 project template. This template is designed to help you quickly set up and start developing your Nuxt3 applications. It comes pre-configured with several essential packages like PNPM for package management, AntFu ESLINT for code formatting, @nuxtjs/i18n for internationalization, and @nuxtjs/tailwindcss for styling. Follow the instructions below to set up the project, run it locally, build it, and check for linting errors. Happy coding!

## Setup a project
Install the packages as following:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Run locally
```bash

## Linting
